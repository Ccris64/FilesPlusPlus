# Files++
Files++ is a Python file browser for Windows. It support shredding files, deleting directories, and ignores all system-protected files.

Files++ advantages:
  - It has a preview for text files, view them without opening anything! (Limited to files under 1mb to evict crashes and freezes)
  - Toolbox: Tools for shredding, deleting and editing files and directories
  - Ignores protection: Browse through system folders, perfect for power users! (I didn't tested deleting system files)
  - Run executables directly from the program: Files++ is not just a file deleter and shredder, but also can run .exe files!
  - Edit button: Edit your files with a single-click (Limited to Notepad)

Files++ is not recommended to use as a default file manager, as it is still in pre-release and may contain bugs.
NOTE: Files++ is freeware, and I am not reponsible for any damage by deleting protected system files.

## How to use it
When you run it, Files++ will show you the C:\ directory.
Files++ uses an address bar and a file list, just like original Windows Explorer.
To see details about a file/folder, single click it on the list.
To open a directory, double click it. You can also go back by clicking the ".." on the top of the list.
To open a file, double click it. (The file should be a .exe file, or else it wont run.)
You can type the location on the address bar, and hit the Enter button (Not on keyboard, but on the program itself.)

### Toolbox tools
The Toolbox tools are the buttons on the top right, inside the Toolbox frame.
These are the tools you will use to manage your files.
The first tool deletes the selected file/folder. This includes folder with files insides. There is no confirmation, so make sure you are deleting the right file/folder.
The second tool overwrites the file with zeros and then deletes it (Thats what I call shredding). This makes hard to recover the shredded files, or impossible at all.
Third tool edits the file with Notepad. NOTE: Large files may crash notepad **hardly**. So make sure you select the right file. This option is rarely used because there are better text editors and you probably want to work with Explorer.
The last tool runs the file if its an exe. Basically the same as double-clicking it.

### ABOUT
Files++ is total freeware with no ads, no paid stuff, nothing.
By accessing protected system folders, you accept that I am not responsible by getting your system destroyed. This is mostly for educational purposes.
